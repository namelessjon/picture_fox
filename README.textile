h1. Picture Fox

h2. Introduction

Picture Fox is a picture viewing application based on FXRuby[1], which uses 
DataMapper[2] to store its metadata.  

It's (increasingly loosely) based on the PictureBook application from 
_FXRuby: Creating Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby_, by Lyle Johnson[3], and is principly a project for me to learn FXRuby/GUI programming and also to experiment with the new DataMapper gem.

h2. Usage

Install the nessary gems:

<pre>
<code>
  gem install fxruby image_science

And follow the "instructions":http://www.datamapper.org/getting_started.html on the DataMapper site to get the latest DM.
